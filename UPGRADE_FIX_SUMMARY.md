# Upgrade Process Fix Summary

## Problem Identified
The upgrade process was not properly installing the enhanced TUI files (`mark-tui-enhanced`), causing users to not receive the new UI when updating the application.

## Root Cause Analysis
1. The original upgrade script only copied files from the `bin/mark` executable and `lib/` directory
2. Enhanced TUI files like `bin/mark-tui-enhanced` were not being copied during upgrades
3. Users retained the old TUI version even after upgrading

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Upgrade Script (`lib/commands/upgrade.sh`)
- **Added explicit copying of all TUI files** including `mark-tui-enhanced`
- **Enhanced backup process** to preserve TUI files during upgrades
- **Improved error handling** for TUI file operations
- **Added verification steps** to ensure all files are properly copied

### 2. Updated File Handling
- **Copy `mark-tui`** - Original TUI file
- **Copy `mark-tui-enhanced`** - Enhanced box-free TUI file
- **Proper permissions** - Ensured all TUI files are executable
- **Backup preservation** - Preserve existing TUI files during upgrades

### 3. Enhanced Documentation
- **Updated README** with information about enhanced upgrade process
- **Enhanced help system** to document new upgrade functionality
- **Clear instructions** for users to understand the upgrade process

### 4. Testing and Verification
- **Created test script** to verify TUI file handling during upgrades
- **Verified executable permissions** for all TUI files
- **Tested backward compatibility** with existing installations
- **Confirmed preservation** of templates and configuration
