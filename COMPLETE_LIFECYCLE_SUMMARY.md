   - Updated `mark` command in PATH with latest version

### Verification Results
- ✅ Version command working correctly
- ✅ Help system showing wizard options
- ✅ Configuration management with wizards
- ✅ Template management with wizards
- ✅ Interactive mode functionality
- ✅ Fuzzy finder integration when available
- ✅ Backward compatibility maintained
