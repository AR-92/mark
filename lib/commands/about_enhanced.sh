**Version:** 1.0.0

## üìù Description

`mark` is a powerful Bash-based tool for generating AI/MCP-ready prompts from templates with support for placeholders, file substitution, conditional blocks, and loops.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Placeholders**: `{{variable_name}}` for simple variable substitution
- **File Substitution**: `{{@file_path}}` to include content from other files
- **Conditional Blocks**: `{{#if condition}}...{{/if}}` for conditional content
- **Loop Blocks**: `{{#each array}}...{{/each}}` for iterating over lists
- **Template Management**: List, show, create, edit, delete, and rename templates
- **Configuration Management**: Set, get, and list configuration options
- **Interactive TUI**: Beautiful terminal interface with Gum integration

## üöÄ The Power of mark for AI Agents and Prompt Creation

`mark` transforms how AI agents and developers create, manage, and deploy prompts by providing a robust templating system that enables:

### 1. Dynamic Prompt Generation
Generate thousands of unique prompts from a single template by varying input parameters.

### 2. Modular Prompt Architecture
Build complex, reusable prompt components that can be combined and nested.

### 3. Context-Aware AI Agents
Enable AI agents to dynamically construct prompts based on user context and preferences.

### 4. Production-Ready Prompt Orchestration
Deploy AI systems that generate prompts on-demand with error handling and validation.

## üéØ Novel Use Cases

### 1. Automated Code Review Agent
```bash
# Template for code review prompts with dynamic rules
./mark generate code_review_template.md project_context.md > review_prompt.txt
# Agent uses this prompt to review pull requests with project-specific guidelines
```

### 2. Personalized Learning Assistant
```bash
# Generate customized lesson plans based on student progress
./mark generate lesson_template.md student_profile.md > personalized_lesson.txt
# AI tutor delivers adaptive content tailored to each learner
```

### 3. Multi-Language Content Generator
```bash
# Create localized marketing content with cultural adaptations
./mark generate content_template.md localization_data.md > localized_content.txt
# Automatically generate region-specific campaigns
```
